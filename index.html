          <p>Coaching is helping someone through the desire to change.</p>
          <p>A coach can help you improve your effectiveness and performance, focus your priorities so that you are not derailed by the day to day and help you overcome what is holding you back from living the life you want.</p>

        <div>
          <p>If you answer yes to any of the below questions, then coaching may just be what you are looking for:</p>

            <li>Are you in a job that you are not enjoying or is not filfulling you?</li>
            <li>Do you feel like you have missed out on the career that you wanted?</li>
            <li>Do you want a change but you are not sure what?</li>
            <li>Do you feel that you are not getting the recognition you deserve?</li>

        <p>I found these sessions hugely productive, and they really helped me to rationalise my thoughts about future career progression, what I wanted out of my next role, and whether or not I wanted to stay in my current organisation.  At the start of the sessions, I knew I wanted a different role, and by the end I had accepted a new job in a different company.  Talking through my options and structuring how I thought about pros and cons was invaluable in determining what I truly wanted out of my career and therefore my next move.</p>

        <p>Jackie was excellent at guiding me through these discussions, helping me to identify key issues and spot mental blockers to me taking action.  She remained neutral and allowed me to come to my own conclusions, pushing me to explore certain areas in more depth.  She is extremely personable and easy to talk to, and I very much enjoyed and looked forward to these sessions.</p>

        <p>Jackie was a professional, warm and encouraging coach who facilitated open conversations without directing or guiding. I was able to explore issues that I was facing in a relaxed setting and arrive at solutions at my own pace. Jackie is respectful of feelings and engages in a dialogues without suggesting resolutions. I was able to tackle situations I was facing and have seen actual results in my life and behavior following the sessions.</p>
